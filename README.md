# FANG-Economy-Project
Group project to validate the Corporate Nation Theory postulated in one of our college courses. I was fortunate to be part of an immensely talented group - Akanksha, Ajay and Satvik. 
The project examines how the revenues of the companies at the helm of the technology revolution in our times - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google have fared, both standalone as well as in relation to developed and developing nations around the world.
